## Data inspection

The two files to inspect are:

`fang_et_al_genotypes.txt`
`snp_position.txt`

First the files information should be inspected.

	```ls -lh *```

We learn that `fang_et_al_genotypes.txt` is a large file and might run into some issues if we try to open it.

The following commands bring us some more details about the files.

> file fang_et_al_genotypes.txt
wc fang_et_al_genotypes.txt
file snp_position.txt
wc snp_position.txt

We learn that `fang_et_al_genotypes.txt` has a large number of headers (corresponding probably to the loci).
